## ðŸ“‹ Summary
This project mainly aims at developing a supervised machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease in indiviuduals.
The data contains 3390 rows and 17 columns. It is based on an ongoing study in Framingham, Massachusetts.
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. 
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). 
The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. 
Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. 
Visting hospitals for regular check-ups it is almost always seen that they encourage people to get special check-ups 
to identify if they are at the risk of heart diseases. Heart diseases have unfortunately become very common. 
It may be due to various reasons such as lifestyle, work pressure, lack of exercise etc. In this project, 
we will be working on predicting 10 year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). We are given a set of variables which impact heart diseases.
These variables are related to demographic, past and current medical history.

The project has been conducted in 5 steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Transformation
4. Model Building and Evaluation
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
